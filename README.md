# Microcontroller-PIC-and-PC-app
GUI desktop app for controlling tasks on microcontroller pic(Microchip)

Microcontroller app for microchip PIC controler was created in programing language C
  -Setting up serial RS-232 communication for microcontroller
  -Setting up interal interupts 
  -Adding users functions to task controller with default time(up to 5 functions/tasks)
  
Desktop app was created in C# 
  -Setting up RS-232 serial comunication for COM port on PC
  -Load initial data(task states) from microcontroller
  -Setting GUI interface for manipulating with tasks
  
It is possible to manipulate tasks via PC, without the need to stop the operation of the microcontroller.
